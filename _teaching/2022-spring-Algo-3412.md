Design and analysis of algorithms. Asymptotic analysis as a means of evaluating algorithm efficiency. The application of induction and other mathematical techniques for proving the correctness of an algorithm. Data structures for simplifying algorithm design, such as hash tables, heaps and search trees. Elementary graph algorithms. Assignments include written work and programming assignments. 


Course objectives
======
By the end of the course you are expected to gain the following skills:

1. earn skills on analysis of algorithms.
2. learn how to determine the asymptotic growth of algorithms and how to apply probabilistic analysis for non-deterministic algorithms. 
3.	study various algorithms of the areas of sorting, searching, hashing, string matching, and graph algorithms with reviews of elementary data structures (binary search trees, hash table, etc.). 
4.	study design techniques of randomized, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. 
5	learn about the limits of computation by looking at NP completeness.
6. learn necessary skills to apply the knowledge on algorithmic analysis from a competitive programming perspective.
