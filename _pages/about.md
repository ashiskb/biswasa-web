Welcome! I am a data scientist and researcher involved into the design, development and analysis of machine learning algorithms into solving real-world problems in the context of **Responsible AI**. I am also an educator teaching graduate level breadth courses and under-graduate level technical elective courses covering machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning and Bioinformatics. In the computer science department, I run the **[Machine Learning Laboratory (ML Lab)](https://ml.cse.ucdenver.edu)** where I supervise a bunch of undergraduate, MS and PhD students who are working on several collaborative research projects to make a positive difference in the community we live in.

I earned my Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu) in 2016, my M.S. and B.S. both in Computer Science and Engineering from [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd) in 2009 and 2008 respectively. My schoarly works have been published in MLWA, IEEE/ACM TCBB, BMC Medical Genomics, NetMAHIB, JBCB, BMC Bioinformatics other outlets. Although many of the published works cover problem in genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic domains, later I expanded my research problem area into several other fields including education, human development, cybersecurity, NLP and NLU, medical imaging with the help of a few amazing collaborators and colleagues at CU Denver.
